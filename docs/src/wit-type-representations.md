# WIT Type Representations

Similar to any other guest langauge, there are multiple type systems in play when dealing with JS WebAssembly components. Types represented in [WebAssembly Interface Types ("WIT")][wit] must be converted down

## Basic types

Here is a basic table of conversions between WIT types and JS types:

More complicated types that are built into WIT but require more work to translate are explained below.

## List (`list`)

### WIT Syntax

```
list<u8>
list<string>
```

### Jco Representation

Jco represents lists with native Javscript Arrays, with some exceptions:

| Type       | Representation (TS) | Example                      |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| `list<u8>` | `Uint8Array`        | `list<u8>` -> `Uint8Array`   |
| `list<t>`  | `T[]`               | `list<string>` -> `string[]` |

## Tuples (`tuple`)

### WIT Syntax

```wit
tuple<u32, u32>
tuple<string, u32>
```

### Jco Representation

((( TODO )))

## Records (`record`)

### WIT Syntax

```wit
record person {
    name: string,
    age: u32,
}
```

### Jco Representation

((( TODO )))

## Variants (`variant`)

> [!NOTE]
> See the [Variant section of the WIT IDL](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md#item-variant-one-of-a-set-of-types) for more information on Variants

Variants are an enum-with-data type in WIT -- this means that alternative values may also hold *different*
kinds of data. For example:

```wit
variant exit-code {
  success,
  failure-code(u32),
  failure-msg(string),
}
```

### WIT syntax

```wit
variant filter {
    all,
    none,
    some(list<string>),
}
```

### Jco Representation

Jco represents variants as objects with a `tag` that represents the variant, and `data` that represent the content:

For example, pseudo Typescript for the of the above `filter` variant would look like the following:

```ts
// Filter with all
{
  tag: 'all';
}

// Filter with None
{
  tag: 'none';
}

// Filter with some and a list of strings
{
  tag: 'some';
  data: string[];
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> WIT `variant`'s options may only contain *one* piece of data.
>
> You can work around this limitation of variants by having the contained type be a *tuple*,
> (e.g. `tuple<string, u32, string>`), or using a named record as the related data.

## Result (`result`)

> [!NOTE]
> See the [Basic types section of the WIT IDL](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md#types) for more information on Resources

Result represent a result that *may or may not* be present, due to a failure. A result value either contains
a value that represents a completed computation, or some "error" that indicates a failure. You can think
of the type of a result as:

```
Result<SuccessType, ErrorType>
```

### WIT representation

```wit
result<_, string>
result<, string>
```

### Jco representation

In Javsacript, computation that fails or errors are often represented as exceptions -- and depending on how
the `result` is used, Jco adheres to that representations.

When used as an *output* to a function, `throw`ing an error will suffice. Given the following WIT interface:

```wit
add-overflow: func(lhs: u32, rhs: u32) -> result<u32, string>;
```

The following JS function would satistfy the WIT interface:

```js
function addOverflow(lhs, rhs) {
    let sum = lhs + rhs;
    if (Nan.isNan(sum)) {
      throw "ERROR: addition produced non-number value";
    } else if (sum > 4294967295) {
      throw "ERROR: u32 overflow";
    }
    return sum;
}
```

While JS automatically converts numbers, we must be careful to not attempt passing a number
that would *not* fit in a `u32` (unsigned 32 bit integer) via WebAssembly.

> [NOTE]
> How JS treats large numbers is not in focus here, but it is worth noting that
> `Number.MAX_VALUE + Number.MAX_VALUE === Infinity`.

What happens when you overflow a `u32` at the WebAssembly level from your component?

### Typescript Schema

```
interface Result {
  ok: null
  data: null
}
```

## Resources (`resource`)

> [!NOTE]
> See the [WIT IDL description of Resources](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md#item-resource) for more information

Resources represent objects that can not be trivially serialized and send copied to another component or the host. Components or host expose resources almost as a reference to internal state that methods can be called on -- without providing the actual internals of the resource in question.

### WIT representation

```wit
resource blob {
    constructor(init: list<u8>);
    write: func(bytes: list<u8>);
    read: func(n: u32) -> list<u8>;
    merge: static func(lhs: borrow<blob>, rhs: borrow<blob>) -> blob;
}
```

### Typescript schema

the example above could be represented with the following class in Typescript pseudo-code:

```ts
class Blob {
    constructor(init: Uint8Array);

    write(bytes: Uint8Array);

    read(n: number): UInt8Array;

    static merge(lhs: Uint8Array, rhs: Uint8Array): Blob;
}
```

### Example
