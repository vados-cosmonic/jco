// NOTE: since wasi:config's 0.2.0-draft release is messed up ('runtime' wasn't renamed and published)
// we have to manage the deps that get populated here *manually*. 
//
// Attempting to run `wkg wit fetch` will clear out the deps folder, and the folders have to be put back
//
// We need to use wasi:config/store explicitly because that's what wasmtime expects.
// (along with matching up the versions)
//
// Generally `include wasi:config/imports@0.2.0-draft` will work, then the 
// downloaded WIT must be edited manually (and the import below restored)
