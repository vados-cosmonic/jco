# `@bytecodealliance/jco-std`

This [`@bytecodealliance/jco`][jco] sub-project contains shared functionality and
reusable libraries that can be used for building WebAssembly Components in Javascript.

[WebAssembly Components][cm-book] are a WebAssembly binaries that use the Component Model,
an evolving architecture for interoperabl WebAssembly libraries, aplications and environments.

WebAssembly components can be used from server side applications *and* in the browser, and
`@bytecodealliance/jco-std` contains shared functionality and helpers for both environments.

> [!WARNING]
> Browser support is considered experimental, and not currently suitable for production applications.

# Quickstart

`@bytecodealliance/jco-std` can be used in varied ways via it's exports, this section
contains some examples of how to get started quickly.

## Hono Adapter

To use `@bytecodealliance/jco-std` to make building [Hono][hono] applications easier with WebAssembly,
use the `@bytecodealliance/jco-std/http/adapters/hono` export:

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const app = new Hono();
app.get('/', () => "Hello World!");

export { incomingHandler } from '@bytecodealliance/jco-std/http/adapters/hono';
```
